# About the project
Just a simple forum for fans of [Star Wars the Old Republic](https://www.swtor.com) or Star Wars fans in general, to talk about the universe and the game.
You can make characters which users should make that reflect their characters in-game. It's used for roleplay purposes mostly and for the competitions that can be found on the site. This was made as a project to defend for [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg).
